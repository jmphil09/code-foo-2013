/* I used a selection sort algorithm.
 *
 * This algorithm scales on the order of n^2. More precisely it scales as O(n^2) for runtime and linear for memory.
 *
 *
 * Yes, time and space complexity can be reduced for this problem using one of the many search algorithms available.
 * For a problem like this, I would write an algorithm using a built-in sorting method such as:
 *
 * def sortingAlgorithm(scorelist: List[highscore]): List[highscore] = scorelist.sortBy(_._1).reverse
 *
 * If necessary, I would implement a method that operates on nLog(n) time, but I do not think it is necessary for this particular
 * problem because I would assume that most high score lists contain less than one million entries. If this algorithm was to be
 * implemented into an MMORPG such as WoW which could have tens of millions of entries, it might be necessary to optimize this algorithm further.
